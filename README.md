# Project Overview

Northeastern Universityâ€™s Khoury College offers several large-scale classes supported by numerous teaching assistants (TAs). Courses such as Intro to Programming with Data, Discrete Structures, and Fundamentals of Computer Science (Fundies) require substantial lab support managed by TAs. Efficiently allocating TAs to lab practicums presents a significant resource allocation challenge.

While a simple sign-up sheet may seem like a feasible solution, it often leads to sub-optimal assignments. Our objective is to create an optimized TA-lab allocation system that considers TA availability, preferences, and the required number of TAs per lab. Currently, manual scheduling is time-intensive for instructors and may not produce the most effective assignment outcomes.

This project addresses the challenge by implementing a solution to streamline and optimize the TA scheduling process, with the potential for a web-based application to broaden accessibility and impact.
